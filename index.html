-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I often find that an automaton (possibly with some modifications of the basic
concept) is a great way of solving a problem I have. I have used automata as a
basis for spell-checking, to implement search query languages, and creating
text indices (among other things).---Though, so far, I haven't been able to
find a Javascript module (or program) for running, visualizing, and
manipulating automata. So, here I want to gather some ideas of what I'd want
from such a module.

This is spurred by the idea of creating unions of automata. I read somewhere on
the internet that this is pretty efficient. Sooo... If both my text index *and*
my search query is expressed as automata---shouldn't I be able to just create a
union of the two to get the search result? That'd be pretty cool!

There should exist a Javascript module (or package of modules) which can be
used to build and otherwise manipulate automata. It should consist of a slim
production module, and a larger visualizer/editor thingy.


# Features

**Match score:** An automaton execution should return true or false in the form
of a numerical value (where 0 is false, >0 true). Each transition can be
provided with a weight affecting the final value (default: 1)---this is
intended for use with fuzzy matching (so that a lower match score can be
returned when something matched fuzzily).---I think this value should be a
multiplier? I.e. at start the score is set to `1`, and then each transition
have a transition weight value which is used to multiplying the current match
score.

**Minimized size:** What format should be used for storing an automaton? It
should be lightweight and simple, and allow for all the parameters needed with
minimal redundancy. Is JSON good? (JSON seems a little bloaty with its repeated
property names, and curly brackets and quotes.) Or should it be a special
(binary?) format? (A binary format will lose readability, so not super good
either.)

**Hooks:** Transitions and states should be able to run custom code. Maybe this
would be the thing to use to build up a string to highlight the search results?
An arbitrary object (initially empty) with data should be passed along which
the hooks can work with, and which will be returned at the end of the
execution.


## Slim

The *slim* version just do the bare minimum. It contains the base functions
needed to build and manipulate an automaton, and to load and run it, or compile
the 'source code' (in JSON format?) of an automaton into an automaton which you
can run.

* Build
* Load/fetch automaton over internet
* Run automaton


## Medium

The *medium* version includes the *slim* functions, but add some manipulations
of the automaton.


### `fuzzify(CUTOFF)`

Modify an automaton to make it match fuzzily, i.e. add whatever states and
transitions needed to match using [Damerau--Levenshtein distance].---This allows
approximate matches by allowing for spelling errors (missing, or extraneous or
swapped characters). A fuzzy automaton by necessity grows in size, compare to
its non-fuzzy ancestor. When a match is done using one (or more) fuzzy
transitions, the match score should be lower than if only 'hard' transitions
where used.

Anything beyond CUTOFF number of spelling changes will not match (be careful,
to large CUTOFF values will make your automaton explode in size).


### Union

Combine two automata into one in such a way that if either one matches the
final automaton will match (logical OR).


### Intersection

Combine two automata into one in such a way that only if both match the final
automaton will match (logical AND).



## Big (Visualizer/Editor)

The *big* version is more bloaty, and is meant for visualization and editing.

* [Railroad diagram] editor/visualizer
* [State diagram] editor/visualizer
* *[Nondeterministic][NFA]* → *[deterministic][DFA]* conversion.
* Convert EBNF into an automaton ([Youtube: "EBNF and Railroad Diagrams"](https://youtu.be/Pgb2O6O-Eug))
* Input/output: [Extended Backus--Naur form]
* Load/save
* Regex → Automaton
* Automaton → Regex

# File Format

The following is [DFA File Format] for automatons. (Here the characters of the
alphabet can be listed as ranges. The first state under `.STATES` is the
initial state, and accepting states have a trailing `!`.)

```
.ALPHABET
a-b d-r t-z
c s
.STATES
start
seen_c
seen_cs!
.TRANSITIONS
start   a b d-z  start
start   c        seen_c
seen_c  a-r t-z  start
seen_c  s        seen_cs
seen_cs a-z      seen_cs
.INPUT
hellocsstudents
.EMPTY
lyrics
cstwofourone bstwofournone
```

This is the [FSM simulator] code for the above illustrated automaton. One of
the rules uses underscore (`_`) instead of comma (`,`) since comma results in
an error message.

```
#states
s0
s1
s2
s3
#initial
s0
#accepting
s3
#alphabet
[
_
value
]
#transitions
s0:[>s1
s1:value>s2
s2:]>s3
s2:_>s1
```

The above code is kinda verbose, and I thing it would work to start off with a
list of initial and final states, then just list the transitions (without
    explicitly listing the allowed states and alphabet). May be something like the
following?

```
initial: 0
final: 0
0 > 1 [
1 > 2 value
2 > 3 ]
2 > 1 _
```

[JFLAP] is a software for visualizing automata and converting between different
types of them. It seems excellent, but has a (very verbose) XML-based file
format (`.jff`) for saving automata. (See under 'Sample files' on [their
webpage][JFLAP].)


# Scoring

Some kind of scoring system is needed. That is, I want to be able to feed an
input string into my automaton and get *all possible solutions* returned, and
given a score. This way, when an automaton is expanded to allow for fuzzy
matches we can rate the score gotten (a non-fuzzy match gets a higher score
than a fuzzy one) allowing the non-fuzzy matches to appear first in search
results.


# As a Text Index

If the final state can link to additional data, then a simple finite state
automaton can be used as a text index. Imagine, for example, the following
simple automaton (`(…)` = state, `▶(…)` starting state, and `((…))` = final
state):

```
▶(a) → (b) → (b) → ((a))
           ↘         1
             ((c))
               2
```

This index of two items ('abba' and 'abc') carries an additional number of
metadata (maybe the index in an array of additional information).

An input string of 'abba' would thus return true, with the additional metadata
'1'.
