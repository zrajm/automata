* TODO SVG images should adapt to dark mode
  + Using 'currentColor' in SVG only works if the SVG is inline.
  + May use `<style>` inside the SVG when is included in a webpage using
    `<img>`, however, this is not compatible with the dark mode override
    toggler---unless, there's a way using Javascript to tell an image that it's
    supposed to render in dark mode? (Probably not, but I haven't researched
    this.)
* FINISHED
** DONE Use plain ASCII dashes, quotes and ellipsis
   CLOSED: [2025-07-10 Thu 12:11]
   Replace “”‘’—– and … with ASCII. These are prettified by Quotecurl anyway,
   and using plain ASCII makes source files easier to search in the terminal.
